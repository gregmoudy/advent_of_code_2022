# Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas. 
# For that, their favorite snack is a special type of star fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. 
# The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.

# To supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of fifty stars by December 25th. 
# Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.

# Collect stars by solving puzzles. 
# Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. 
# Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
